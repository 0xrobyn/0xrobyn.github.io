    <h2>what's this site?</h2>
    <p>this is where i spew ideas and i guess some form of a portfolio. i love systems and operations and live my life "systemsmaxxing" i'm fascinated by infrastructure, aviation, transit, urbanism, finance, media, art, music, tech and how they all intersect.</p>
    
    <h2>my worldview</h2>
    <p>infrastructure is power made physical. i see the world as one big interconnected network - airlines, trainlines, finance, the internet. it's all systems woven together, written in different languages whether that's money, python, or protocols. understanding these systems isn't just technical curiosity - it's about seeing who has access and who doesn't. logistics is politics. every barrier is a choice someone made about who gets in and who stays out. consider your threat models and attack surfaces carefully.</p>

    <p>i love figuring out ways to do what i love and get into spaces i want to be in. that's why i work in aviation (flight benefits = freedom of movement + seeing how the network actually functions), work festivals (because i LOVE concerts), and am learning event production. networking is my superpower. i've social-engineered my way into some wild situations (ate lunch with run the jewels, got invited to a private travis scott show, almost got hired by delta, contributed towards kanye's 10th album tracklist - stories for another time).</p>

    <h2>security knowledge stack</h2>
    <p>i studied AP CS in high school and took C# OOP classes (CSIS 1400/1410) while working on my comptia a+/net+/sec+. then right before graduating i fell into a years long depression where i dropped out of college and had to reorganize my entire life, and now i'm picking up the pieces with a.. much less malleable brain should we say, but hopefully with enough adderall i can get the job done.</p>
    
    <p>now i'm rebuilding. i don't necessarily want a career out of tech (feel free to email ur job offers tho :-)) i'm doing this because i'm genuinely fascinated and because in today's world where LLMs are becoming modern infrastructure, my goal is to break them. everyone on tech twitter calls themselves "security researchers" when they know nothing. i know damn near nothing right now too, but i'm learning and hope to post real research soon and join your CTF teams &lt;3 hopefully my lack of performative sf job begging will give me the brain space to actually do good research</p>
    
    <h2>what i'm learning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>linux systems (fedora main btw, studying for linux+)</li>
        <li>python & C</li>
        <li>networking (hopefully for network+)</li>
        <li>computer architecture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>even if LLMs write all the code, it still runs on the same infrastructure, understanding the base layer matters and my at least ideal would be to make a better "breaking things" mindset later.</p>

    <h2>other loves!!</h2>
    <p>i love love love french house music and breakbeats!! ask me anything about 90s vinyl only french house releases and i will tell u..</p>
